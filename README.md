# CPSC 349-01 Spring 2021 Final
## 3D Tic-Tac-Toe in React

by Timothy Bui

Modified base Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial code from React to support a 3D board with all win conditions updated accordingly. 

In addition to standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules, players can now also win by scoring 3 in a row vertically.

All work was done in [index.js](https://github.com/TimothyBui/CPSC349_final_3dtictactoe/blob/main/src/index.js)

Example screenshot of what it looks like from my end.
